*Difficulty: a thing that is hard to accomplish, deal with, or understand.*

One of my friends asked the question earlier last week -- why is it so hard to manage a team? Why is so hard compared to working on the lowest level, with little to no responsibility? This question came after he struggled a little with managing a group of construction workers.

Now I gave him the standard answer - being a manager of an organization requires that you allocate your time between a schedule and seting deadlines. There isn't anyone telling you what to do. It's the answer any good mentor would give, and is mostly true.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
