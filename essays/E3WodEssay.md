This essay pertains to the Invoice1 WOD. In preparation for this WOD I made sure I had a firm understanding of basic mathematics because I understood what was going to be required, behind the scenes to render the appropriate information. Although I felt confident rewarding the basic math involved. Applying the code that represents the mathematical computations was a bit of a challenge and took some considerable time learning it. Similarly to previous WODs I first went straight to watching the video and made sure I understood the total concept and layout. Then I attempted with the timer. Of course after a few tries I became more and more proficient.
There’s not much I could’ve done in order to prepare. Other than what I mentioned above. I find the current strategy is working great. Well on second thought, next time I might try the WOD at least once before watching the video.
